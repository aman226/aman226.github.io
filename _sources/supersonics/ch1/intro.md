# Chapter 1: Introduction to High-Speed Flows

High-speed aerodynamic flows form the basis of modern aerospace systems operating at transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds. These flows are governed by the principles of compressible fluid dynamics, where variations in pressure, density, and temperature are intrinsically linked to the flow velocity. The fundamental non-dimensional parameter used to classify compressible flow regimes is the **Mach number (M)**:

$M = \frac{u}{a}$

where:
- $u$ is the local flow velocity, and
- $a$ is the local speed of sound in the medium.

## 1.1 Flow Regimes Based on Mach Number

The Mach number determines the qualitative behavior of a flow field and its interaction with surrounding geometry. Compressible flow regimes are classified as follows:

### Subsonic Flow ($M < 1$)
- Pressure disturbances can propagate upstream.
- For $M < 0.3$, compressibility is negligible.
- Governing equations are elliptic in nature.
- Typically smooth and predictable flow.

### Transonic Flow ($0.8 < M < 1.2$)
- Contains both subsonic and supersonic zones.
- Local shock waves and flow separation are common.
- Highly sensitive to geometry and operating conditions.
- Mixed-type governing equations (elliptic + hyperbolic).

### Supersonic Flow ($M > 1$)
- Disturbances cannot propagate upstream.
- Shock waves and expansion fans dominate flow structure.
- Governing equations are hyperbolic.
- Strong compressibility effects present.

### Hypersonic Flow ($M > 5$)
- Exhibits strong shockâ€“boundary layer interactions.
- Significant high-temperature effects:
  - Vibrational excitation
  - Molecular dissociation
  - Chemical reactions
- Requires thermochemical and viscous modeling.
